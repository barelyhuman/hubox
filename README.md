# Why ?

- I need something that shows me the currently available notifications
- The read and unread state of github's notifications isn't very intuitive and should be something I maintain in the app instead

# TODO

- [ ] github-store
  - [ ] Should work offline
  - [ ] Sync more issues when online
  - [x] Should show the newest unread 10 first
  - [ ] Be able to fetch all if needed
  - [ ] Fetch the comments and everything from the particular github id
